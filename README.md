Therfore,our reserch aims to help Government allocate resources in order to produce the best possible results.. 
At the same time,We extract information from open-data including "population statistic", 
"building data", "hospital location" ect.., and then employ spatial analysis to find out 
which area should get first concern. 
After that, Govenment can not only allocate scoail resource accurately 
but also meet the physical and mental demand of senior citizen via our research.
