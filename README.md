Therfore,our reserch aims to help the government aid the elderly issues effectively. 
At the same time,we extracted information from open-data including "population statistic", 
"building data", "hospital location" ect.., and then employed spatial analysis to find out

After that, th govenment can not only allocate social resources accurately 
but also meet the physical and mental demand of senior citizen via our research.
